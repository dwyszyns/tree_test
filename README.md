Tree Implementation in Python and Tests (PyTest)
Trees

    Binary Search Tree (BST)
    Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree (AVL)

Methods

    create: Create a new node in the tree.
    delete: Remove a node from the tree.
    display: Display the contents of the tree.

Testing with PyTest

We use PyTest to write and run tests for the BST and AVL tree implementations. These tests cover the create, delete, and display methods to ensure the correctness of the tree operations.
